# Blinkit Architecture

## Overview
Blinkit is an on-demand grocery delivery platform that connects users with local stores for quick and reliable delivery. The platform has multiple components, including user interfaces (mobile/web), backend services, real-time inventory management, order management, and logistics. The architecture is built to handle scalability, high traffic, and real-time updates.

## Components
### 1. **Frontend (Client-side)**

#### Mobile App (iOS/Android)
- **Technology Stack**: React Native / Flutter / Native iOS (Swift), Native Android (Kotlin/Java)
- **Features**:
  - User login and registration
  - Browsing products and categories
  - Search functionality
  - Cart management
  - Order placement and tracking
  - Notifications (via push notifications)
  - Payment gateway integration
  - User profile management
  - Location tracking (for delivery)

#### Web App
- **Technology Stack**: React.js / Angular
- **Features**:
  - Similar to mobile app features but optimized for desktop.
  - Admin panel for managing products, orders, customers.

### 2. **Backend (Server-side)**

#### Microservices Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js / Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring Boot), Go, etc.
- **Key Services**:
  - **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  - **Product Service**: Manages product catalogs, inventory, and product data.
  - **Order Service**: Responsible for managing orders, including creation, tracking, and status updates.
  - **Payment Service**: Integrates with third-party payment gateways (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.) for processing payments.
  - **Logistics Service**: Manages delivery assignments, geolocation tracking, and route optimization.
  - **Notification Service**: Handles SMS, email, and push notifications.
  - **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests products based on user behavior and preferences.

### 3. **Database Layer**

#### Databases
- **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL
  - Used for storing structured data like user accounts, orders, and payment transactions.
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB / Cassandra
  - Used for unstructured data like product catalog, user activity logs, and recommendations.
- **Cache Layer**: Redis / Memcached
  - Caches frequently accessed data such as product details, category information, and user sessions for faster access.
  
### 4. **Real-time Communication**

#### WebSockets / MQTT
- Used for real-time features such as order tracking, inventory updates, and communication with delivery agents.

### 5. **DevOps & Infrastructure**

#### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS / GCP / Azure
- **Services**:
  - **Compute**: EC2 / Kubernetes for microservices.
  - **Storage**: S3 / Cloud Storage for storing images, documents, and other assets.
  - **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes for orchestrating microservices.
  - **CI/CD**: Jenkins / GitLab CI / GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

#### Load Balancer
- **Technology Stack**: AWS Elastic Load Balancer, NGINX
  - Distributes incoming requests evenly across backend servers to ensure high availability and load balancing.

### 6. **APIs**

- **RESTful APIs**: For communication between client and backend services.
- **GraphQL**: For efficient and flexible data fetching.
- **Third-party APIs**: Payment gateway integration, location services, etc.

### 7. **Analytics and Monitoring**

- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), NewRelic
- **Purpose**: Monitoring application performance, real-time analytics, tracking user behavior, and ensuring application health.

### 8. **Security**

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0
- **Encryption**: TLS/SSL for secure communication
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR-compliant data handling and storage.
- **Firewall**: Protects services and data.

### 9. **Delivery Management**

- **Geolocation Services**: Google Maps API / Mapbox for route optimization and real-time location tracking of delivery agents.
- **Fleet Management**: Real-time tracking of vehicles, route optimization using AI/ML algorithms.
